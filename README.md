# üîê AWS Security & DevSecOps Projects by Domain

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of hands-on **AWS Security** and **DevSecOps** projects, organized by security domains and automation pipelines.

My goal is to demonstrate how real-world AWS services, security controls, and DevSecOps practices can be applied to:
- Design secure and scalable cloud architectures  
- Automate threat detection and remediation  
- Enforce IAM best practices and compliance  
- Build secure CI/CD pipelines and monitor infrastructure in real time  

Whether you're a Cloud Security Engineer, GRC Analyst, or DevSecOps practitioner, you'll find practical implementations mapped to industry best practices and tools.

### üß≠ Project Overview

| Domain | Focus Area | Sample Topics |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Threat Detection & Incident Response | Real-time alerting and auto-remediation | IAM credential revocation, public S3 auto-remediation |
| Security Logging & Monitoring | Centralized visibility and observability | CloudWatch, Lambda log triggers |
| Infrastructure Security | Network-level protection and segmentation | VPC design, VPN, endpoints, private S3 |
| Identity & Access Management (IAM) | Federated access and least privilege | SSO, Web Identity Federation, cross-account access |
| Data Protection | Encryption and secure storage | S3 object encryption |
| Management & Governance | Compliance, architecture & assessments | Terraform IaC, Prowler scanning, secure baselines |
